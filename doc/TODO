* TODO
** add functionality
*** wait for file, socket instead of process
*** add more efficient implementations instead of polling the proc-table
*** explore ptrace for process tracking 
*** cleanup printing of process-table to actually get tabbing right
*** find a way to pass pids of still-running / dead pids to the program in exec
This could be {} like in the find -exec option.
** tried but failed
*** BSD
attempted BSD process accounting but turned out ugly,
because of huge file that monitors every process in the system +
required root-access to start monitoring
