* TODO
** cleanup configure scripts
** write help
** add functionality
*** wait for process, socket ... 
*** add more efficient implementations instead of polling the proc-table
*** explore ptrace for process tracking 
*** cleanup printing to actually get tabbing right
*** find a way to pass pids of still-running / dead pids to the executed program 
** tried but failed
attempted BSD process accounting but turned out ugly,
because of huge file that monitors every process in the system +
required root-access to start monitoring
