       pward - monitor the lifecycle of a set of running processes.

       ppwwaarrdd  monitors  a  set  of  processes  given  at  the command-line. By
       default, pward stops when all specified processes have  died.   Option-
       nally,  it  stops  when a specified number of processes has stopped, or
       when less than a specified number of processes is  still  running.   It
       can be configured to execute a specified command before stopping.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --rr, ----rruunnnniinngg=n
              stop  monitoring when no more than n processes are still running
              (default 0)

       --ss, ----ssttooppppeedd=n
              stop monitoring when at least n processes have stopped  (default
              1)

       --ee, ----eexxeecc=_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
              Execute  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  after the treshold is met, and before pward is
              stopped.  The command  is executed in the starting directory.

       --vv, ----vveerrbboossee
              summarize monitored processes at startup.

       --bb, ----bbaattcchh
              don't perform sanity checks at input. This can  be  useful  when
              invoked from a script

       --hh, ----hheellpp
              print a help message at startup

       [[PPIIDD]]  space separated list of process-ids to be monitored.

       The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

       non numeric parameter
              The input parameter is not a number

       command failed
              the command in the -exec option failed to execute


BBUUGGSS
       pward  checks  processes  by polling the proc-table.  This is portable,
       but a better implementation  using  modern  kernel  features  is  badly
       needed.

       Shuts  down  the  machine  10 minutes after emerge finished.  Some info
       about the monitored processes is dumped to the console at startup.  The
       polling  interval  is  set to 10 seconds.  The user needs the rights to
       shutdown the machine for this to work.
